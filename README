# About the Book

A guide to Symfony 2 is intended to be the tutorial and reference that I would have liked to have found when I began my first project using the framework.

The plan is to provide, in the first instance, a tutorial walking the reader through the creation of a simple blogging style application, starting with the first download of the Symfony 2 code base through to a basic working application. This first section of the book will cover the major principals and uses of Symfony components such as the Routing, Controllers, Models and Templates. Where appropriate it will provide introductions to features to be covered in more depth in the second part.

I currently intend for section one to remain freely available online and in the free sample version of the eBook. The text for these chapters will be hosted in a github repository, as will the code for each stage of the tutorials. The further sections available in the paid copy of the eBook.

Once I feel I have written enough of section one to make it worth reading I will be publishing it online and will make the sample version of the eBook available. Those that wish to support the continuation of the book can also buy the eBook at that point and will continue to receive all future versions of the book for no additional cost. I'll set the price low initally, as a thank you to early supporters, and will slowly increase it over time as the book fills out. (At this time I have no idea what the price will top out at, but I'm sure it still be 'cheap'.)

The book's second section will look at using 3rd party bundles and common practices for creating your own. There will be introductions to, or further investigation of, topics such as Dependency Injection, creating your own services, and working with the Events system

For section three we'll delve deeper into the components of the Symfony framework, examining their use individually and the relationships between them in a 'traditional' Symfony application.
