# Chapter 1 - The Preambles
It should be noted straight away that neither myself Phil Rennie nor the contents of this book are in any way associated with or endorsed by Sensiolabs, the Symfony developers or anybody else at all.

Heck, they probably don't even know it exists. But I'm glad you do.

Hello and happy reading.

## Acknowledgements

This book would not exist if not for the Symfony framework itself, so the first acknowledgement should go to Fabien Potencier, dsfdsd and everyone at [Sensiolabs](http://sensiolabs.com).
As this book is being written whilst I learn the Symfony framework I also owe a massive debt of gratitude to everybody who has already contributed to the Symfony documentation and cookbook, mailing list and forums, and to all the bloggers who have already taken time to share their knowledge with the world. In particular I would like to mention

- person 1
- person 2

If your name is not on this list, and you have written about Symfony somewhere online then I'm going to go out on a limb and thank yo on behalf of everyone that has read your work. I'm probably one of them.
 
## About the author

Phil Rennie is a geek. From the first lego brick lifted to the last word of this book writen and beyond, he's been mucking about with 'stuff' his whole life. You don't leave him alone with your toys and a screwdriver.

Phil's day job for the last 7 years has been building web sites and applicatiions of increasing complexity, and for the 6 years before that he was an I.T. guy (but one of the nice, helpful ones). He's been developing primarily with PHP since he started and loves and loathes the language in almost equal measure. 
He's far to misguided to ever learn a compiled language, but he's trying to learn Polish (which feels like learning Java, but less icky.)

He maintains a portfolio of previous work and a geeky blog at [philrennie.co.uk](http://philrennie.co.uk) where there is also the online version of the free portions of this book.

## Intended Audience / Prerequisites

This book is not intended as an introduction to PHP programming in general nor to building dynamic websites. I will assume that the reader has already been building sites of their own and is already familiar with PHP, object oriented design, and working with an RDBMS like mySQL. 

I'm hoping you are already aware of terms like D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself), 'Seperation of concerns', and of the M.V.C. (Model, View, Controller) pattern. If you are not yet using them but they are one of the reasons you would like to use Symfony then Appendix x provides a brief introduction to the them and links to further reading.

We will not be covering HTML or CSS other than where it's required to demonstrate their relationship to certain Symfony components. HTML and CSS files to keep the examples presentable will be available as part of the downloadable code accompanying this book.

When it comes to managing code I prefer to use Git [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com) and I'll be maintaining the manuscript and example code of this book using it.

It is not a requirement to use git and you will be able to download any examples easily from your browser. However using Git is the easiest way to obtain the examples and I highly recommend learning git anyway. A brief introduction with links to further reading can be found in Appendix x.

As I'm assuming you are already coding with PHP I'm also going to assume you have picked your favourite text-editor or IDE. I will breifly cover some available extensions and plugins available to customise some popular editors for Symfony coding in Appendix x.
